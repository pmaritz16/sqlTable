write a javascript program to run on windows to load CSV files into tables of sql database.
the program should use a graphical user interface built using SVELTE.
the program should use sql.js for its database.
each file should go into a separate table.
the paths to csv files should be obtained from an config file.
the path to the database file should also be stored in the config file.
the path to the config file should be obtained from the user at start-up.
a default config file should be created for the use, with a default path for the database file.
the use should be given the option of using the default config file.
the CSV files specify the schema of the data in the first line of the CSV file, using the following convention, "column name:column type, column name:column type, ...".
column type can be "string" or "number".
if no column type is given, the the type of the column defaults to string.
if columns are missing from a line in the CSV file then balnk values shoud be assumed.
Once loaded, the program should the user to navigate between tables, displaying the contents to the user in a scrollable, tabluar layout.

update the program to allow the user to enter commands in natural language,
these commands should be translated into SQL by a LLM,
and then stored in a log file, which is stored at a default location.
The user should be able to view, in a separate view, the log file and edit its contents.
The user should be able to toggle between the table view and the view of the log file.
The user should be able to select an entry in the log file and have that command and subsequent ones executed against the current selected table.
Any errors should be displayed in the log file view.
